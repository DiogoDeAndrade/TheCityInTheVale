# The City In The Vale

This is a game done for the 3st Game Design Club challenge (Text Only) at the Universidade Lus√≥fona Game Development degree.

The player explores a world using normal 3rd person view, with a rendering effect to seem to be made from text, and has to interact with the environment and objects with a text interface.
