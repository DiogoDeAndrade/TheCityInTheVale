  - "8 June 1951\r\n\r\nI've found the most curious book in the Miskatonic University
    library... \r\nAt first glance, it looks like the mad ramblings of a certain arab
    called \r\nAbdul Alhazred, but on closer inspection it reads more like a mix of
    occult \r\nvisions and fanciful reinterpretations of History. \r\nIt tells of
    titans of a time before the dawn of Men.\r\nIt is most peculiar, at the same time
    disturbing and compelling, and I can't \r\nseem to be able to put it down!"
  - "27 September 1951\r\n\r\nThe book has been consuming my life for the last few
    months.\r\nAs I dig deeper into the arcane incantations and the vivid descriptions
    of\r\nnightmares, I'm more and more convinced that there is some truth to some
    \r\nof the insanity of the mad arab!\r\n\r\nReinterpreting some of Plato's writings
    on Atlantis and Er, they are chillingly \r\nclose to some of the more descriptive
    ramblings of Abdul Alhazred.\r\nI've even cross-referenced some of the terrifying
    creatures of Norse, Egyptian\r\nand Greek mythology with some of the drawings
    (that I'm convinced we're drawn in blood!)\r\npresent in the book!"
  - "7 January 1952\r\n\r\nI've secured some funding from the University and some
    good men of the city.\r\nI feel they're giving me their money moreso from pity
    than an actual belief in the \r\nstrange visions I'm painting in my own ramblings...
    \r\nI feel I'm falling into the same delusions as the mad prophet (as I now think
    of him),\r\nbut I can deny my feelings on this matter anymore as I believe the
    sun will rise again\r\ntomorrow...\r\nMy extensive research into the book and
    all the cross-referencing I've done have bear\r\nfruit, as I'm fairly confident
    about the location of one of the ancient cities of this lost \r\nforgotten civilization."
  - "14 April 1952\r\n\r\nWe've arrived to the island I identified as the location
    of the great city of Zak'vuur.\r\nI see no trace of civilization, but if I am
    right, it has been millenia since anybody\r\nwalked these shores.\r\nTomorrow,
    me and my men we'll start moving inland..."
  - "15 April 1952\r\n\r\nBlast it! While passing through a cleft, one of my men disturbed
    some large rocks, that\r\ndislodged and fell down, killing my men and blocking
    my path back!\r\nI'm alone now...\r\nI should go back to the boat and get more
    men....\r\nI should...\r\nI shouldn't...\r\nI can't...\r\nI need to move forward...\r\nI
    feel it..."
  - "16 April 1952\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort, I've dragged what remains of my equipment
    towards a valley. \r\nI've noticed a purple light shining in the night, and I'm
    using it to guide my way, through \r\nthe night and most of the day...\r\n"
  - "16 April 1952 (cont.)\r\n\r\nI've found it, the valley!\r\nI set up my camp near
    a ancient structure...\r\nInitally, that structure looked just like a cave entrance,
    but on closer inspection it revealed \r\nthe entrance to a structure... Strangely,
    it seems to be the only structure around.\r\nI'm a bit disapointed, since I was
    expecting to find a whole city, but even a structure that can\r\nprovide me a
    clue about the fate of this civilization older than Mankind would be worth it!\r\nNight
    is falling, so I'm waiting until the morning to start my investigations.\r\n\r\nI
    can't shake the feeling that something is watching me, but it is probably just
    my nerves...\n"
  - 'There''s an hastily scribled note in the last page of the diary.

    It says 12L8R5L.'
